# How to merge cells horizontally in GridView


<p>GridControl doesn't support horizontal cell merging. Â Please useÂ <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/windowsforms/12063/controls-and-libraries/spreadsheet">Spreadsheet</a><u>,</u>Â which supports cell merging:<br><br><a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/windowsforms/15416/controls-and-libraries/spreadsheet/examples/cells/how-to-merge-cells-or-split-merged-cells">How to: Merge Cells or Split Merged Cells</a> <br><br>

If you have a simple layout in your GridView and need to merge several cells, you can try emulating this functionality using the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/762/Controls-and-Libraries/Data-Grid/Appearance-and-Conditional-Formatting/Custom-Painting/Custom-Painting-Basics">Custom Drawing functionality</a>. This example demonstrates the main idea of how to do this. 
<br/><br/><b>Important Note:</b> since this is just an example, but not a complete feature (which would require much more code) - you will need to manually adapt the example code according to your scenario.
