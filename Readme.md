# OBSOLETE: Windows Forms - How to merge cells horizontally in a grid UI

We recommend that you use the [WinForms Spreadsheet](https://documentation.devexpress.com/windowsforms/12063/controls-and-libraries/spreadsheet) control if you need a grid UI with the built-in cell merge feature. See the following topic for more information: [How to: Merge Cells or Split Merged Cells](https://documentation.devexpress.com/windowsforms/15416/controls-and-libraries/spreadsheet/examples/cells/how-to-merge-cells-or-split-merged-cells).


The [GridControl](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/3455/controls-and-libraries/data-grid) does not allow you to merge cells horizontally in v17.1 and higher.
